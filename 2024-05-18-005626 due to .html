	<p>The expression <em>due to</em> has two uses, one formal and one informal.</p> <h2>Formal writing and speaking</h2> <p>In formal writing and speaking, <em>due</em> is used as an adjective. It normally acts as the subject complement after a linking verb. <em>Be due to</em> means <em>result from</em>:</p> 
<ul>
 <li>Marjorie’s car troubles are due to (result from) a problem with the alternator.
</li>
 <li>Some people say that Vancouver’s growth has been due to (has resulted from) the arrival of wealthy immigrants.
</li>
 
</ul>
 <h2>Informal writing and speaking</h2> <p>In informal contexts, <em>due to</em> has become a compound preposition equivalent to <em>owing to</em>; it is used to introduce an adverb phrase. This usage is not yet fully accepted in formal writing and speaking. For that reason, for an adverb phrase in formal writing, you may prefer to use <em>owing to, because of</em> or <em>on account of</em> instead.</p> 
<ul>
 <li>The founders of Goderich thought their city would flourish, owing to (<em>not</em> due to) its deep, natural harbour.
</li>
 <li>Because of (<em>not</em> due to) the storm, the trip was postponed.
</li>
 
</ul>
