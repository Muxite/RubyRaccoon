                This isn’t what everyone would do to an ex; it depends what sort of person you were dating.Someone with narcissistic traits, who has felt like their ego is bruised, is more likely to go out of their way to flaunt a new partner just to make you jealous.They’ll want to show off how they can get someone else.For them, it will be even better if they’re particularly attractive!Your ex might be plastering their new romantic interest all over their social media, or turning up to the places you and your friends hang out, just to show off this new person they’ve pulled. They might want you to think: look who I’m capable of getting if the person is objectively attractive. But, remember, there’s no guarantee they’re actually a nice person!As if that’s not enough, your ex might be trying to make it look like he doesn’t really care about the relationship you two had, while he actually cares more than you could know.  If you still think you want to <a href="https://hackspirit.com/should-i-get-back-with-my-ex/">get back with your ex</a> despite their blatant attempts to make you jealous, then you need to look closely at why.It comes back to a sense of worth that I spoke about earlier.

<img alt="Was vs were title" class="img-responsive" src="https://marketing.prowritingaid.com/was-vs-were-title.png"/>If you want your writing to be clear and effective, you need to conjugate your <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/Verbs" target="_blank">verbs</a> correctly.The verb “to be” is an <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/irregular-verbs" target="_blank">irregular verb</a>, which means it’s trickier to conjugate into the past tense than many other verbs. It has two past tense forms that many people mix up, <strong>was</strong> and <strong><a href="https://prowritingaid.com/were" target="_blank">were</a></strong>.So, when should you use <strong>was</strong> and when should you use <strong>were</strong>?

    This is a post that arose out of another thread, but I wanted a broader audience because it's interesting.  Another redditor <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PacificCrestTrail/comments/epngpm/fyi_small_bars_with_400_calories_spotted/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">posted</a> about some bars they found from a company called Off the Farm.  I'm a long distance hiker myself, so I really wanted to check these out.   I ordered a variety pack directly from the company website (not Amazon), and I told the company that their product was being discussed on this subreddit and asked if they could substitute a couple additional flavors into the box.  Instead, they wrote back that they just threw a few more bars gratis in the box.
  
    The bars arrived today and my son (another hiker - 15yo) and I did a taste test of most of the flavors (we would have tried them all, but we were getting a bit full...) .  The bars range from 330 to over 400 calories and there is a pretty wide selection of flavors.  In general, we found most of the bars (the fruitier ones) to be moister than any other energy bars we've tried, and the use of fresh ingredients was very obvious.  Here are the flavors we tried and our thoughts:
