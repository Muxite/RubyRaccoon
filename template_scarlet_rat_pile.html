                What is Scarlet Rat?
            </h5>
            <p>Scarlet Rat is a demonstration of Selenium Webdriver and static-site-generation using Python, HTML, CSS, and JS</p>
            <p>It provides interesting results from websites throughout the internet and posts snippets them all in one place.</p>
            <p>It is presumably like how a rat or a bird would make a nest.</p>
            <br>

                How does Scarlet Rat work?
            </h5>
            <br>
            <h6>Scarlet Rat runs on Python and manipulates HTML CSS and JS as an output.</h6>

            <ol>
                <li>Make a search term using a few words from a sample text.</li>
                <li>Open Chrome and search up the sample text.</li>
                <li>Select a random website and open it.</li>
                <li>Scan the HTML to make a list of lowest level Divs.</li>
                <li>Create a "block" using a Div with sufficient content. Save the time, search term, and link as well.</li>
                <li>Load a "block template", which is an HTML file with replaceable sections.</li>
                <li>Package the "block", time, search term, and link into the "block package".</li>
                <li>Repeat as many times as nessesary to make packaged blocks.</li>
                <li>Load a "scarlet rat template", another HTML file with replacable sections. This text is written in the template!</li>
                <li>Organize all the blocks by time, and stuff them into the "scarlet rat template".</li>
                <li>Save to the main HTML file. Update github using .bat file.</li>
            </ol>
