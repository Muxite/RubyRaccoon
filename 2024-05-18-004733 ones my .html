<img alt="it’s finally out?? 𝑓𝑎𝑟 𝑡𝑜𝑜 𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑔．．#ˡⁱⁿᵏ ⁱⁿ ᵇⁱᵒ seems mad how we wrote 𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 ft. @justlil back in 2019. so much has changed since then but feels timeless as I listen back. 

This project explores my sonic identity / headspace as I navigate overwhelming changes.  A celebration of love and its lessons. #xxx 𝓁 ．  ℐ．  𝓃 ．  𝓀．  𝓘．  𝓷． 𝒷 ． ．𝒾．  𝒪 ☆～(ゝ。∂）@petesimmons , thankyou for always being there. you’re a rare one. ଘ(੭ˊᵕˋ)੭* ੈ✩‧₊˚@justlil____ you were my day one. we spent years making sketches and trying again. pushing ourselves and never settling for anything less than undeniable in how we hear it. I feel like we worked it out together. when I tell@𝑦𝑜𝑢 that lil has some heat in her locker, believe me. ꒰ღ˘‿˘ற꒱❤⃛ @kehina I knew from@when we met at pirate studios that we would continue to write together at some point. we got back in touch during lockdown. those times with you helped me process the thoughts in my kind and led to us making some of my favourite records to date. 𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑚 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒._____thankyou anyone who’s listening. anyone who’s played a part in letting me release this piece how I heard it.
