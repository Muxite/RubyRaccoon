You will be relieved to know that when other people look at you in real life, they are more likely to see what you see when you look in a mirror (without the reversal) rather than what you look like on phone pictures.</span></p> <p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">Why? Three reasons, which are all to do with the laws of optics and perspective:</span></p> <p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;">Number of apertures</span></p> <p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">A phone camera has a single aperture, which means it can only view your face from a single point. But (most) people can see with both eyes, so they are seeing you with </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;">two </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">apertures spaced a small distance apart, and their brain then combines these images to produce a more complete image of you, with more of your head and facial features being visible than through a single aperture.</span></p> <p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;">Depth perception</span></p> <p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">Also, of course, they will see a </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;">three-dimensional </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">image of you, rather than the two-dimensional image obtained through a single aperture; they will perceive the </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;">depth </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">and </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;">shape </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">of different features of your face (as you do when you look at yourself in a mirror)—information that is not available in a flat two-dimensional image.</span></p> <p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; background: none;">Viewing distance</span></p> <p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">Finally, if you are taking a selfie, or someone else is taking a picture of you from quite close-up (say, no more than 4 feet away), the closeness of this single aperture to your face will tend to produce an image which looks rather distorted when compared with a picture taken from a greater distance. This distortion will make your face look more rounded (albeit a two-dimensional projection of this roundness), with your nose—being closer to the lens—appearing quite large and your ears—being further away from the lens—appearing smaller. Viewed from a greater distance, your face will appear less distorted, with the relative proportions of your various features in more realistic relationships to each other.</span></p> <p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">To summarise, then, if you want to have a more realistic idea of how you look to other people, </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;">stop taking so many selfies,</span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;"> because they will never show you at your best! But if you want to take a more </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;">realistic </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">picture of your face using your phone, and don’t have someone who can take it from a decent distance (perhaps using zoom), then take a picture of yourself in a mirror (again, perhaps using zoom), because you will immediately </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;">double </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">the </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; background: none;">optical </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">distance between your face and the camera lens, and so you will at least be able counteract the unflattering distortions of short viewing distance in typical phone pics.</span></p></span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
