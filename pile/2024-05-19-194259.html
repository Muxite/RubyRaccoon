<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:03" data-dur="00:07">We started, it was a little, about 11 miles, and well, this is  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:10" data-dur="00:04">where they started to get rough, now. And, of course, I was  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:14" data-dur="00:06">young. The only thing I had was a bullet that grazed me here,  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:20" data-dur="00:03">but it was nothing wrong. Some of our boys were wounded  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:23" data-dur="00:04">quite bad, and as they fell out, they bayoneted them. </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:27" data-dur="00:04">We could not do nothing about it. They just would bayonet  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:31" data-dur="00:02">them on the side of the road and that was it and you just had  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:33" data-dur="00:04">to keep going or you would die too. So we just kept going  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:37" data-dur="00:07">along, and you know. This was probably the hardest part </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:44" data-dur="00:03">when you realized that you know, what was going to happen.  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:47" data-dur="00:02">It could be your friend. This could’ve been my brother.  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:49" data-dur="00:03">But the ones that had been wounded and couldn’t walk, </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:52" data-dur="00:02">and some of the different ones... One fellow I could see  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:54" data-dur="00:03">when they put the bayonet in, they drove it in through the  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="00:57" data-dur="00:03">back of his shoulder. And another fellow, they put a  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:00" data-dur="00:04">bayonet right through his wrist and they left him there.  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:04" data-dur="00:05">I don’t know who picked him up but we seen him after.  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:09" data-dur="00:04">Well, then he had, the wrist was twisted because of  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:13" data-dur="00:03">no treatment. When he came back from the war he had </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:16" data-dur="00:04">a twisted arm, like the wrist. So we marched down to </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:20" data-dur="00:07">the barracks. After we got in there for a few days it was fine, </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:27" data-dur="00:05">and the North Point Camp, we had to clean it up. I think </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:32" data-dur="00:03">Chinese lived there and I think somebody said horses had  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:35" data-dur="00:04">been in there. Anyway, we cleaned that up for a while  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:39" data-dur="00:04">and everything was not bad and then they started to put </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:43" data-dur="00:06">up barbed wire. Electric wire went along side of it afterward. </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:49" data-dur="00:03">Then they started to get tough, and there was beatings. </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:52" data-dur="00:04">Everybody was getting beat up and this and that.  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="01:56" data-dur="00:04">The food came down, we started to lose weight. </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:00" data-dur="00:06">If, like the Chinese, some of the Chinese people, they liked </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:06" data-dur="00:03">you or something, maybe they knew somebody, because we </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:09" data-dur="00:05">had everybody in there:  British, Dutch, people from Java,  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:14" data-dur="00:06">Canadians. We didn’t have Americans there yet. But, they’d </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:20" data-dur="00:05">pass some food through the fence and the Japs saw them, </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:25" data-dur="00:05">they would tie them to a pole and they would bayonet, bayonet  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:30" data-dur="00:06">practise on them, bayonet practise. But not to kill them, in the </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:36" data-dur="00:04">arm, in the other arm, or this and that. Them poor people tied </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:40" data-dur="00:04">up and they left one fellow there at night. I can still see him </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:44" data-dur="00:03">with the head down and tied and couldn’t move.  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:47" data-dur="00:02">The next morning they cut him down and he was dead, and  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:49" data-dur="00:05">they just threw them into the China Sea. I guess that’s the </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="02:54" data-dur="00:06">part of it that goes between Hong Kong and the Kowloon. </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="03:00" data-dur="00:04">They'd just throw them overboard there. So we, at that </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="03:04" data-dur="00:04">time, we had no toilets. We had to go to the sea wall and we </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="03:08" data-dur="00:08">had to do our works there and, of course, then we started to get  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="03:16" data-dur="00:04">lousy and everything started to go bad and some of the boys  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="03:20" data-dur="00:04">were getting desperate. Some could not quit smoking. </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="03:24" data-dur="00:04">This was the worst for them, and others were hungry. </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="03:28" data-dur="00:06">A lot of others were, I would say, they couldn’t take it as  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="03:34" data-dur="00:02">tough as the farm boy. We came off the farm and we come  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="03:36" data-dur="00:04">off that Depression. I think if they didn’t have a hard time,  </span>
<span class="wb-tmtxt" data-begin="03:40" data-dur="00:02">they failed faster than us. </span>
