                Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Gotoubun no Hanayome and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. <br>
<br>
Based off a popular manga of the same name Gotoubun no Hanayome which is also better known by its English title The Quintessential Quintuplets is a romance, comedy, school and harem genre anime that gives us the unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day a high school boy who as a result of trying to keep both his family and his
                  <span class="js-visible" style="margin-left: -4px;">...</span>
          <span class="js-hidden" style="display: none;">life afloat and ahead of the many debts that his father has incurred which has created nothing but misfortune for his life that ensured that he has not just no friends but very few money is presented with a once in a lifetime golden opportunity to turn things around. An opportunity that will not only allow him to get a regular salary that will go a long way in helping keep his family afloat with its debt but also allow him to keep them happy as well. But what turned out to be a simple tutoring job for our hero Fuutarou Uesugi is that instead of teaching just one person he is rather teaching five of them and these five rather than being strangers from different families are instead sisters who are all related by blood. <br>
<br>
School-based romantic comedies are without a doubt one of the most popular genres within the anime world due largely to the fact that school itself presents a perfect environment  in which to tell not just an interesting story but also provide its cast with numerous but easily relatable situations that many students can understand and relate too while still remaining light-hearted and comedic. Notable animes of this type that I found to have really enjoyed in the past included Yamada Kun and the Seven Witches and The World God only knows. However, what sets The Quintessential Quintuplets apart from other such anime however is the fact that not only is the main character one that is simultaneously trying to live the live of a high school boy while struggling with the unique financial demands of modern-day family life, but he’s also presented with a unique opportunity that will help alleviate it if he accepts. The catch here is rather than merely teach one person as would be expected of a typical tutor he instead will be teaching five girls who are not only sisters by blood but are all averse to studying which presents to Fuutarou a bit of a dilemma since his job is to ensure that all of the girls pass all their exams. The first episode of the series while certainly an enjoyable one also did well not just in introducing Fuutarou and the five sisters but also in showing just how different the five of them are not just physically but in attitude as well as well as showing just how hard this supposedly easy job will be for Fuutarou. As a result of this episode, I have to say that I become curious to see how this story would actually turn out and whether or not the sisters and Fuutarou would as they learn together not only end up passing their exams but also develop as people as well. <br>
<br>
The overall story for The Quintessential Quintuplets is set in a modern day Japan that’s not dissimilar to the one that we see with our very eyes and follows the life of Fuutarou Uesugi a high school student who despite being in the midst of his teenage years in which normally he will be surrounded by caring and understanding  friends and enjoying the time that high school kids get to bask in but alas for Fuutarou this is nothing but an unachievable dream. For as a result of the large financial debt that his father had incurred Fuutarou despite being a mere high school boy has to not just work hard at managing the family’s finances but at the same time work hard at finding a part-time job that will allow him to better support his family a goal that until now was nothing but a dream. However, this sense of seeing this as a dream is soon shattered when Fuutarou on a seemingly average day has an encounter with Itsuki Nakano a beautiful but seemingly  quiet girl who had recently transferred to his school who tries to hire him as her tutor to which he promptly refused much to her shock due to the low salary usually involved. However, this is a decision that Fuutarou soon learns to regret for the job in question not only offered a substantial salary but also one that will enable him to pay off the majority of the debt that they had incurred. Desperate to make amends and try and get back the opportunity of a lifetime that he had seemingly threw away Fuutarou after much effort manages to do so but finds to his surprise that rather than teach only one person he was in fact going to teach five of them who coincidentally are sisters by blood. <br>
<br>
In this wacky romantic comedy that Fuutarou finds himself in he must not only contend with the most difficult task of not just convincing each of the five sisters to overcome their dislike of studying but also impart within them all the knowledge that they will need in order to pass their exams and earn him the salary that he so much desires. But as Fuutarou works at trying to make the sisters realize the importance of studying he as a result of getting to know them not just as students but as individuals also starts to find himself changing as for the first time in a long time he was not only interacting with people his age but also in the process discovering that while it was certainly frustrating in trying to convince the girls to study it was also oddly fun and satisfying as well. This serves to create a question. Who really is the teacher here? <br>
<br>
Fuutarou <br>
<br>
Fuutarou Uesugi portrayed by veteran voice actor Yoshitsugu Matsuoka of Sword Art Online and Food Wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A high school student that attends the local high school to which the Nakano sisters also attend Fuutarou on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, calm and intelligent person by nature that was noted early on to have a rather curious talent for money management. While certainly a quiet person that preferred to keep his eyes in his books than at people Fuutarou was also shown to be a perceptive, determined and fast thinking person that can at times show unexpected kindness and care to others when he can. However, despite living the life of a high school student which normally would mean that you will be having the time of your lives with your friends and enjoy the time that youth brings you it can be said that this is something that sounds almost as alien to Fuutarou as not studying would to him. Indeed while Fuutarou despite clearly possessing excellent levels of intelligence that have enabled him to score high test scores in tests rather than make use of this as a means to forge deep friendships with his fellow students is instead seen to do the opposite in that he not just stays away from them but actively tries to stop others from approaching him as well as shown in his first encounters with Itsuki. Despite the apparent loneliness that can come from having no friends that he can mingle with and have fun with both at school and outside of it can be seen rather curiously that rather than feel despair as some would Fuutarou instead is seen to not mind this at all seemingly preferring the sense of peace that came about as a result. As the series goes on however it can be seen that this unique attitude of his is due to the large financial debt that his family had inherited from their father. This debt due largely to how large it is can be seen to be one of the major reasons for Fuutarou’s attitude towards life. While its easy to imagine that the reason for Fuutarou’s aloof nature towards friendships is due largely to his quiet nature and his love of studying when put alongside the debt it can be seen that rather than this the reason for Fuutarou’s nature is due to his desire of safeguarding his families finances first and ensure that both him and his sister Raiha are able to both live comfortably and safely. As a result of this underlying desire it can be seen that rather than him being a loner the opposite is instead true for Fuutarou is instead prioritising the safety and well-being of his sister at the cost of his own fleeting social life something that I felt while sad was also something deserving of admiration and a great indication of just how much Fuutarou cares about family. <br>
<br>
As the series goes on however and Fuutarou gets to not just meet the five sisters and get to know them not just as students but also as friends as well his personality gradually starts to expand. At the beginning of the series largely due to his desire to study and do well in his exams in order to attain a better future for both himself and his family Fuutarou was noted to have a curious sense of disdain towards relationships with others both in terms of social relationships like friendships and romantic relationships. However, rather than being scared of it as some would assume it can be seen that this is largely a result of the belief that anything that distracts him from studying is, in essence, wasting his time. However, this belief of his while certainly giving him plenty of time and opportunity to allow him to study to his hearts content and attain the grades that he was aiming for can also be said to have an unfortunate side effect as this meant that in addition to having a non-existent social life Fuutarou also had a distinct lack of experience in speaking to others and to girls in particular. This aspect while certainly comical due to both the comical reactions that it has on the sisters and the many misunderstandings that it causes to both Fuutarou and the sisters also serves to illustrate just how lacking Fuutarou was in his comprehension of what friendship and bonds are to a human being and how important they are to one’s life. At the beginning of the series it can be seen that the primary reason that Fuutarou took up the job of being a tutor was due largely due to the large salary that was promised and as a result he while seeking to fulfill his primary mission of raising the grades of the sisters can be seen to only see it as a job and conversely only saw the sisters as his students and nothing more. However, this attitude of his gradually starts to change as a result of not just interacting with the girls but also coming to understand that despite their great wealth each of the girls to have their own unique struggles and problems that they not only want to keep from both their friends but also from each other as well. As a result of the ever-increasing bonds that are forged between the sisters and Fuutarou and the gradual opening of their inner hearts to him Fuutarou though at first hesitant in trying to get involved in the affairs of others gradually starts to break free of his hesitation and try to understand the unique problems that each girl had. While each of the girl’s problems were unique ones that ended up posing quite the challenge for Fuutarou due to both his limited experience in social life and his blunt attitude it can be said that these experiences while certainly allowing Fuutarou to help each sister resolve their personal struggles and in the process increasing the bond that exists between them also serve to change Fuutarou’s personality as well. <br>
<br>
While still remaining quiet to a degree Fuutarou as a result of both getting to know the inner selves of the sisters and also coming to understand the unique struggles that each hid within them slowly began to realize just how important it was to not just forge bonds with others but also maintain them as well for within society even if you have top tier grades in every required subject and exam you wouldn’t get far if you distance yourself from others and make no attempt to establish a social life of your own. As a result of this realization Fuutarou while still somewhat direct with his words also starts to show more consideration towards others both in terms of his words and in the actions that he takes in helping others which is shown well in his attempts to help each of the girls solve their problems as the series progresses despite his initial reluctance to get involved with them. This development in Fuutarou’s character I felt was an interesting one as while allowing Fuutarou to meet five unique girls who despite being sisters all have differing personality’s that required some effort to get used too also made Fuutarou realize that even if he had continued on with his path on continuous study he would not only not get the result that he wanted but also become more and more distant from society than he was now. Though he can initially be seen to treat the tutor role as nothing but a job as the series progresses and Fuutarou’s bond with the girls improve this can be seen to change as he begins to see not just the value of friendship and bonds and how useful it can be to him in terms of his future. At the same time seeing this realization also manifest on a personal level with regards to Fuutarou’s realization of just how much fun and brightness friendship can bring to ones social life was also fun to see as it highlighted the fact that while Fuutarou was indeed the tutor the girls too were in their own way teaching him what he was missing in his life as well which is that of friendship and bonds. <br>
<br>
Itsuki Nakano  <br>
<br>
Itsuki Nakano portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and A Place Further Than The Universe fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the Nakano Sisters that Fuutarou teaches within the series. The fifth and the youngest of the sisters within the family and the first sister that Fuutarou meets within the series Itsuki on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, confident, stubborn and curious person by nature that while friendly to all that she meets is also shown to get angered quite easily which when paired with the fact that she can get embarrassed easily serves to contrast her personality quite well. While a diligent, serious and determined person by nature that somewhat mirrors Fuutarou’s base nature unlike Fuutarou Itsuki is also someone that can show kindness and care to others when needed and indeed is also shown to be surprisingly perceptive to the inner struggles of others as shown when she determined the true reason for Fuutarou wanting to do well in his role despite the opposition that he faces. In the beginning of the series due largely to Fuutarou’s personality Itsuki’s first impression of Fuutarou was seen to be a rather bad one and as a result, their relationship was seen to be a rather frosty one. As a result, it’s no small surprise that upon the reveal that Fuutarou was not just going to be showing up more around her but also that he was taking the role as their tutor that Itsuki’s relationship with him become antagonist. However, despite this sense of antagonism towards him, it can be seen Itsuki true to her curious nature is also someone that is logical by nature that can be relied upon to determine the actual truth behind a circumstance before making a decision herself. This aspect of hers when paired with her honest and fair nature I felt matched really well with both her personality and her role as the mediator within the sisters that can be trusted to be impartial with her judgment. <br>
<br>
As the series goes on however and Itsuki gets to understand Fuutarou as both as a person and as a tutor her personality gradually starts to change. As noted previously Itsuki’s first impression of Fuutarou was seen to be a rather bad one and as a result, the relationship that existed between them on their first meeting as student and tutor was seen to be a rather frosty one. Indeed, for this reason, Itsuki along with her sister Nino served as the focal opponents to Fuutarou’s early attempts at getting the sisters to be serious at studying with her notably showing a rare physical display of opposition to him. However, as the series goes on and Itsuki gets to see both Fuutarou’s efforts to teach her and her sisters and the efforts that he puts in to help them solve the personal struggles that are preventing them from studying effectively this attitude of hers begins to change. While still wary of Fuutarou to a degree Itsuki however was shown to be willing to place her trust in him in his plans and at times willing to assist him if the particulars of the plan are explained properly to her. While becoming visibly kinder and more considerate of the feelings that Fuutarou may be hiding beneath the surface however Itsuki was also shown to be wary of the distance that is between her and Fuutarou seemingly mindful of the teacher-student relationship that exists between them perhaps hinting that her feelings are developing into something more. Of all the sisters of the Nakano family, Itsuki can be seen to be perhaps the closest to Fuutarou in terms of personality due largely to the fact that both are seen to be stubborn in their beliefs and liable to be triggered by the most trivial of subjects. Indeed this aspect of hers that she shared with Fuutarou while serving to cause often comical quarrels between the two also served as an excellent indicator of the change that Fuutarou was imparting within her as it was only with the quarrels that she was able to realize that while some changes may be unpleasant and hard to get used too if she doesn’t make the effort to understand the benefits of it then she will never be able to advance in life. In a way, it can be said that the stubbornness that both Itsuki and Fuutarou possess though often causing them to quarrel with each other was at the same time causing them to realize this flaw of theirs and contributing in advancing both of their respective personalities for the better. The character of Itsuki I felt was an interesting character due to the contrasts that exist between her personality and her role within the series and the stormy relationship that she has with Fuutarou. <br>
<br>
Ichika Nakano <br>
<br>
Ichika Nakano portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of 3 Gatsu No Lion and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the Nakano sisters that Fuutarou teaches within the series. The first sister and within the family the acknowledged elder of them Ichika from initial appearances is seen to be a confident, teasing and playful person by nature that true to her personality is someone that loves to play pranks on others for her own amusement and indeed she is bold enough to try that on males her age as well. Unlike most high school girls her age Ichika is someone that can be said to rather unique in that while she understands the importance of studying and getting good grades she also believes that you shouldn’t spend all your youth studying and that you should take the time to enjoy the time that being a teenager brings you. As a result of this attitude of hers while Ichika was certainly not against meeting Fuutarou and having him as her tutor she didn’t necessarily support his existence within their family either preferring to instead wait and see what happens. Coincidentally upon meeting her for the first time, Fuutarou was also of the belief that Ichika was someone that had the ability to see through him and can either be a powerful ally or a powerful enemy and was someone to be wary of. While a confident and teasing person by nature Ichika was also noted to be someone that cared deeply about the bonds that she has with her sisters and indeed she was shown to be someone that always put the happiness of her own sisters before her own a trait that I felt matched well with her role as the leader and eldest sister of the family. <br>
<br>
As the series goes on however and Ichika’s bond with Fuutarou starts to improve her personality gradually begins to change. While noted from the onset to be a positive, teasing and a calm and composed person by nature that seemed to be able to handle anything it can be seen that in reality the positive and teasing smile that she shows on her face can be seen to be a mask of sorts that serves to both hide her own struggles and failures that have occurred in her life while at the same time converting it into a sense of calmness that she projects to her sisters to reassure them. While this dual nature of hers served to reinforce the fact the Ichika is someone that always puts the happiness of others first it also served to reveal just how lonely she was with her struggles as well as in order to protect her sisters by not just revealing her own failures but to keep at it until she succeeds in her task she was not just putting more pressure on herself but also essentially walking on a tightrope as things can potentially get dangerous if her sisters found out what she really was doing behind their backs. This hidden nature of Ichika felt was an interesting one as while it showed Ichika’s determination to protect her sisters by always being cheerful around them it also served to show the kind of struggles that elder sisters had within the family as well. In the beginning of the series as noted earlier Itsuki’s attitude towards Fuutarou was seen to be a neutral one and while not against the idea of learning from him unlike her sister Nino she was seen to be someone that wasn’t that interested in the idea seemingly preferring to be out than studying. Rather than being a sense of laziness as some would assume it can be seen that this attitude rather is a result of her belief that the learning capabilities of she and her sisters just isn’t good enough for them to be able to pass every exam. However, as the series goes on and Ichika got to understand Fuutarou as a person and at the same time see the lengths to which he will go to help them solve the problems that were preventing them from studying effectively Ichika’s attitude towards him began to visibly soften. While still reluctant to waste her youth studying it can be seen that after this revelation that her previously pessimistic attitude towards it have largely vanished and she has become somewhat determined to do well in her studies. Due largely to the increased bond that has been forged between Ichika and Fuutarou it can be seen that after the revelation that led to this bond that Ichika has become somewhat more open with her feelings willing to express both her wishes and worries to Fuutarou while at the same time willing to listen to his own thoughts as well which is a far cry of how she was before. While becoming more open with her feelings Ichika largely as a result of seeing how much Fuutarou is willing to go to help them solve their problems is also seen to have a developed a desire to assist Fuutarou in not just helping each of her sisters but also ensure that each of them will be able to pass their exams as per Fuutarou’s job. While this can be seen to be a result of both the gratitude that she feels towards him and a desire to see it be used to save her sisters as well the fact that Ichika was not just more caring and helpful towards him while at the same time not being above using cunning to force his hand at something perhaps hints that her feelings towards him have developed into something much deeper. The character of Ichika I felt was an interesting character whose dual nature mask of hers served well to show not just the kind of pain and struggles that people could be hiding under their default natures but at the same time demonstrate well just how much burdens one is also willing to shoulder and sacrifice if it meant that the happiness of those that she cares about is satisfied. <br>
<br>
Miku <br>
<br>
Miku Nakano portrayed by Miku Itou is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the Nakano sisters that Fuutarou teaches within the series. The third sister of the family Miku on initial appearance is seen to be somewhat of a direct contrast to the rest of her sisters in that she’s a quiet, calm, composed and passive person by nature that prefers to keep her own thoughts hidden, unlike her sisters. However, despite her quiet nature and her low self-esteem, it can be seen that Miku is also someone that can be somewhat bold at times as shown in the fact that she doesn’t mince words when she is stating her true opinion of something an aspect that I felt contrasted well with her quiet nature. Due largely to her quiet nature Miku was also seen to be someone that was wary of outsiders and was someone that didn’t trust easily. This combined with her quiet nature made Miku a formidable foe for Fuutarou as she served as one of the first obstacles in his quest to unite the sisters. However, while certainly wary of outsiders and unwilling to trust others easily it can be seen that Miku is also capable of showing kindness and understanding to those that have earned her trust and while her quiet nature often hamstrings her Miku will try her best help them with their problems. As a result of Miku’s personality, it's perhaps unsurprising that she will have few if any friends at school which combined with the fact that she along with her sisters were recent transfer students ensured that her life at school was a lonely one. However, while this sense of isolation may have been too much for some for Miku this can be said to be the opposite as it is in isolation that Miku can be said to be in her element for this allows her to indulge in her interest in ancient history. While interest in ancient history was not something that can be said to be weird to a high school girl of Miku’s age an interest in it was certainly unusual. However, to Miku the tales of ancient warlords who fight bravely on a thousand battlefields in the name of justice, vengeance and conquest can be seen to be something that is very dear to her as to her they present an interesting and intriguing world that she can use to hide herself in and slip out of the hustle and bustle that comes from living in modern day society. While shown to become easily become embarrassed if her little interest was found out it can be seen that this interest of hers rather than being a mere pastime as some would suggest Miku’s knowledge of warlords is instead something that is both dear to her and at the same time something that she takes pride in a fact that is shown well in her desire to prove this by using knowledge quiz’s. This aspect of hers I felt was interesting as considering Miku’s personality it can be seen that her interest in ancient warlords rather than being a mere pastime can be said to be closer to a protective measure that she uses to not just shield herself from society but also create something that she can take pride in. The fact that she is seen to take any challenges to her knowledge of warlords as seriously as she did within the series and ably demonstrating her competitive nature more than reinforced this belief. <br>
<br>
As the series goes on and Miku’s bond with Fuutarou gradually improves her personality slowly begins to change. At the beginning of the series, Miku like her fellow sisters were seen to have a mixed reception upon receiving the news that Fuutarou will not just be seeing them more often but also be taking on the role as their tutor. However, unlike the likes of Itsuki and Nino who vehemently denied the need for a tutor and Yotsuba who clearly wanted him Miku was seen to be somewhat neutral in this regard with her views mirroring that of her elder sister Ichika. However, as a result of not just seeing just how much Fuutarou was willing to go to help them solve their problems and at the same time how far he will go to understanding them as people Miku’s impression on Fuutarou began to gradually change. Largely due the fact that Fuutarou was able to not just match her in terms of intelligence but also because he shown that unlike others that she had met before he was not willing to leave her after finding out about her interest Miku become convinced that perhaps Fuutarou unlike the other tutors before her was not the same and was capable of not just teaching them how to pass their exams but at the same time able to also heal the hearts of each of them by solving each of their individual struggles. As a result of this belief of hers Miku not just become the first of the sisters to open her heart to him but also in the process discover all of the wonderful feelings and emotions that can come from modern day society that she had until now been hiding from. After her awakening while still remaining quiet and passive to a degree Miku was seen to have become much more talkative and at the same time was also shown to have developed an increased level of confidence within herself as demonstrated in her willingness to express her own views and opinions on both people and events which is a far cry from how she was previously. At the same time Miku was also shown to have developed a certain level of fondness for Fuutarou which is shown in both her increased levels of interaction with him and the fact that she was willing to listen to his advice in order to improve her skills both in terms of studying and in other life skills like cooking. At the same time, it can be seen that this level of fondness that she has with him also created within Miku a strong desire to not only pick up studying once more but also add in an additional focus on a subject that’s closer to her heart more than anything. The character of Miku I felt was an interesting character whose development from a quiet girl who largely showed few expressions of obvious feelings while trusting no one to someone that was not just more positive but talkative and trusting as well was well done. While the level of fondness that she developed for Fuutarou was certainly sweet to see the level of effectiveness of this was reinforced significantly by Miku’s desire to answer challenges to this as well as the often-comical results that would come about. <br>
<br>
Nino Nakano <br>
<br>
Nino Nakano portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Ayana Taketatsu of Sword Art Online and Youkoso fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the Nakano sisters that Fuutarou teaches within the series. The second sister within the family and arguably the one that acts as the role that’s closest to a mother within the family Nino from initial appearances is seen to be a friendly, caring and intelligent person by nature that treats her friends and acquaintances with both care and kindness. However, it can be seen that this side of her personality is the side that she reserves for her friends for when dealing with either new arrivals or interlopers who seek to interfere in the unity within her family it can be seen that Nino has another side of her personality that she unleashes on them. Due largely to the fact that Nino views the unity within the family to be of paramount importance to her it can be seen that Nino is someone that views people that will potentially have an effect on it with some might argue an excessive amount of aggression for rather than adopt a wait and see approach as some would have Nino adapts an attitude that’s more akin to getting rid of a threat before it can cause any lasting damage. As a result of this at the beginning of the series along with Itsuki Nino formed the core of the group that opposed Fuutarou’s appointment as their tutor a role that she stubbornly held on to for quite some time within the series even when her fellow ally Itsuki decided to accept the truth much to her dismay. While Nino within this sub-personality of hers mostly retains her calm and friendly nature it can be seen that in addition to this she also developed a significant amount of aggression which when combined with her other newfound traits of cunning and maliciousness served to ensure that Nino was a powerful opponent to Fuutarou’s attempt to unite the sisters and making her a de facto villain within the series. While noted to be a cunning and stubborn person by nature Nino was also noted to be someone that was of the belief that as long as the threat to her family was gone then any tactics that she uses is justified a fact that ensured that she wasn’t above using theatrics and tactics that are a tad underhanded for a girl her age to use. However despite her preference of using such tactics it can be seen that Nino while certainly prideful was not to the extent of not being able to realize it when she goes too far and indeed is one that is willing to own up to her mistakes something that I felt contrasted well with the aggressive tactics that she used in her attempts to safeguard her family. <br>
<br>
As the series goes on however and Nino gets to see first hand the kind of change that Fuutarou was having not just on her sisters but also herself as well Nino’s personality gradually starts to change. While still retaining her confident and haughty nature it can be seen that as a result of the change Nino has learned to be somewhat more forgiving of others and more willing to try and open up her own feelings to them in order to both lessen the risk of misunderstandings and at the same time allow her to get a much better view on the true nature of someone rather than go by her usual aggressive side as she had done so in the past. While still possessing a degree of stubbornness  it can be seen that after the change Nino has become somewhat more understanding of the circumstances of others and willing to lend them her help even if the said person was a sworn enemy of hers in the past a development that I felt was an interesting one as it served to show just how much of an impact Fuutarou’s teachings had on dispelling Nino’s ingrained aggressive nature that she used to protect her family. This within the series is shown well in the way that she interacts with Fuutarou as while still cold to him to a degree her attitude towards him no longer rests on that of sworn enemy number one and indeed she is shown to be willing to help him solve any problems that he has and not in the process see him as the source of it which is a far cry of what she was like before. The character of Nino I felt was an interesting character whose development from a grumpy and aggressive young girl who was not just against the introduction of strangers into the family but at the same time not above using aggressive and sometimes borderline illegal tactics to send them packing in the name of family unity to someone that was not just more understanding and honest with her feelings but also willing to give the benefit of the doubt to strangers I felt was well done. In particular, I feel that this combination of traits was matched really well with Nino’s central focus of ensuring family unity as if this was instead focused entirely on her I felt that the effects that it would have had would have been lessened. <br>
<br>
Yotsuba <br>
<br>
Yotsuba Nakano portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte and Boarding School Juliet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the Nakano sisters that Fuutarou teaches within the series. The fourth sister of the sisters Yotsuba on initial appearance is seen to be a bright, cheerful and friendly person in nature that approaches each day with a smile on her face traits that serve her well in acting as the one that tries hard to manage the mood within the series. A kind, friendly and honest person by nature Yotsuba along with Nino can be seen to be among the sisters that can be said to be enjoying what a genuine high school life should be which within Yotsuba’s case is aided greatly by her honest and loyal nature that ensured that she will have no shortage of friends within the school. While noted to be a positive and friendly person by nature it can be seen that Yotsuba was also someone that was both persistent and perceptive in nature qualities that allowed her to not just notice when something was off with her many friends but also allow her to close in and try and help them if she can a fact that I felt matched her base nature really well. At the beginning of the series due largely to the fact that Yotsuba was the first of the sisters to make contact with Fuutarou, she was seen to be the one that had the closest bond with him a bond that as the series progressed was only seen to improve as the story went on. Despite the fact that Fuutarou was within the school seen to be somewhat of an outcast that would have deterred most people it can be said this aspect is something that proves to be no obstacle to Yotsuba for she despite her scatter-brained nature is someone that is shown to be not just perceptive but also a good judge of character that when used in conjunction with her core belief of someone that just cannot leave those that are in need behind served to create an instant bond between the two that served to create one of his first and strongest allies within the sisters. <br>

As the series progresses and Yotsuba was able to bear witness to not just the improvement in her and her sisters’ grades and at the same time see their personalities Yotsuba’s personality also begins to gradually change. While still remaining her positive, friendly and innocent nature Yotsuba was also shown to have developed a certain degree of cunning within her with a desire to spend more time with Fuutarou in an effort to learn more about him. While this cunning is not on the level of Nino’s aggressive variant that is used to repel intruders it was still an interesting development as it indicated that while Yotsuba was shown to have a very high opinion of Fuutarou due to both his high grades and his personal struggles that mixed  well with the problems of her and her fellow sisters that maybe her feelings towards him as a result of seeing the effect that he had on them had developed to a point that’s above that of a student and teacher. <br>

In terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series main characters were both well designed and developed and featured a great deal of variety that served well to enhance each character. This I felt was shown especially well in the character designs for the five sisters as the five being sisters were almost identical to each other and were thus difficult to tell apart without some kind of visual representation besides that of hairstyle which can easily be changed. In this case, I felt the use of both hair accessories and other miscellaneous items like headphones, stars and hairclips served well to allow us, viewers, to easily see which sister is which. In terms of location settings while the series did not feature a large variety of locations the locations that it feature however which while relatively simple ones served well to show how relevant they are to both the personal circumstances of the characters as well as the venues that served to show the effects of the advancement of each of the main casts personalities within the series. Within the series this was shown in the form of Fuutarou’s apartment which demonstrated Fuutarou’s humble but determined reason to earn money by doing well in his role as a tutor, the Nakano apartment which served as both the girls sanctuary and the girls and Fuutarou’s place of work that allowed both to learn about each other’s problems and start the process of solving them and the camp venue that the cast visit near the end of the series that served to not just allow the girls and Fuutarou to have a memorable time with the schools camping trip but at the same time allow the sisters to show just how much their bond with Fuutarou has advanced as a result of his hard work. <br>
<br>
In terms of music I felt that the series OST was a strong one that while providing an excellent background to the many common scenes within the series also served well to provide a strong backing for the many bonding scenes within the series that served to illustrate well the kind of feelings and emotions the cast felt as they interacted with and gradually bonded with each other. One of my favorites was when Fuutarou managed to save Nino from a dangerous fall that contributed to her advancement in her feelings towards him and the moment when Itsuki and Fuutarou finally came to an understanding after their fight. In terms of opening and ending themes the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Gotoubun no Kimochi that was sung by the seiyuu’s that voiced the five sisters which was Inori Minase, Miku Itou, Kana Hanazawa, Ayana Taketatsu and Ayane Sakura respectively  and Sign that was performed by veteran seiyuu singer Aya Uchida. While both of these songs I felt were excellent ones I also felt that the emotions that both gave off was markedly different from each other with the former due largely to the cheerful and upbeat nature of the lyrics serving to invoke within you that you were going to start a new day tutoring the girls and having fun at the same time while the latter gave off the feeling that the day of tutoring is over and that its time to sit back and relax with the girls and wait for tomorrow to come sentiments that I felt matched well with the series main theme. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. In particular, I felt that Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Inori Minase, Kana Hanazawa, Miku Itou, Ayana Taketatsu and Ayane Sakura who portrayed the characters of Fuutarou, Itsuki, Ichika, Miku, Nino and Yotsuba all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. Miku Itou’s portrayal of Miku I felt was also a surprise as she is someone that despite having amassed an impressive resume of roles is someone that I never encountered before and as such, this is indeed my first time hearing her despite her resume. <br>

Overall conclusion <br>
<br>
In overall Gotoubun no Hanayome was an excellent anime that I felt was definitely one of this season's best ones with its main strong points, in my opinion, being its unique premise both in terms of romantic comedy’s and in the harem genre, its strong story that emphasised on the act of bonding and solving problems together, well designed and developed characters, music and excellent voice acting by a talented voice cast. <br>
<br>
The overall story for the series along with the series premise I felt was definitely one of the series main strong points. While the idea of school-based romantic comedies are nothing especially new within the anime world as seen in examples like the excellent Yamada and the Seven witches series the premise that Gotoubun no Hanayome makes use of can be said to be a relatively fresh one as it pairs a student that while possessing high grades is essentially a social outcast within the school and five girls who despite their wealth are shown to be seriously lacking in education with the relationship of that of a student and teacher. While the struggles that erupt between the Nakano sisters and Fuutarou served to make up the core of the series overall story I felt that the story also did well to combine this with not just the chemistry that is established between the sisters and Fuutarou but also with the characters eventual development both in terms of educational skills and in the bonds that they managed to forge with both each other and Fuutarou. While the series overall story did well in showing the kind of changes that came about as a result of Fuutarou’s hard work it must also be said that the opposite is also true as well for while Fuutarou may have contributed significantly in helping each sister overcome their problems they in turn also helped in changing his own as well and show him the benefits that friendship and bonds can bring to his life. This aspect of trying to change other people for the better while being changed in turn I felt was an interesting aspect that matched well with the teacher-student relationship that lies between the Nakano sisters and Fuutarou. As a final score, I would say that Gotoubun no Hanayome easily deserves a final score of 10/10. The combination of an excellent premise, story, characters and their development with the chemistry of the cast as well as backed by a star straddled voice cast more than ensured that this series was one that I really enjoyed as everything meshed so well together.</span>
