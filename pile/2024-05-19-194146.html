Typically we think if a guy is looking at us and his lips are turned upward, he's interested.</span></li><li class="q-relative" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: relative; margin-left: 2em; padding-bottom: 0.7em;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">However, there are other reasons for grinning. One such horrible possibility is he's imagining hurting you. He could dislike you, or just likes violence in general, and is enjoying the image of you in pain. Or-»</span></li><li class="q-relative" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: relative; margin-left: 2em; padding-bottom: 0.7em;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">He may not be particularly interested in you romantically, but is interested in you physically. He's enjoying the idea of conquering you and making you another conquest. Or-»</span></li><li class="q-relative" style="box-sizing: border-box; position: relative; margin-left: 2em; padding-bottom: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">Maybe he finds you funny. If you don't think you're doing something particularly funny, then he may find something about your habits amusing.</span></li></ol><p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">There may be other reasons, but these are off the top of my head. Before you think I seem a bit obsessed with darkness in fellow humans, it's not that, it's your description. Grinning is odd. Smiling implies softness, no teeth. Grinning implies teeth. This changes things. When a person likes another, they usually smile. They're thinking soft things about you; their heart is involved.</span></p> <p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 1em; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">Grinning while staring changes things. This is more aggressive, cocky. This is the image of a guy assured he can do or have what he wants, not having tender feelings.</span></p> <p class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; overflow-wrap: anywhere; direction: ltr;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; background: none;">Now, if you meant something different, that's up to you. But you did write grinning. Evaluate his demeanor. From what you wrote, I know that would make me avoid him.</span></p></span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
