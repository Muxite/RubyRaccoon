    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>I am a 17 year old who will be attending UBCV for applied sciences this September. I hope to major in Computer Engineering. 
    I do a variety of engineering related projects and hobbies. I program projects, create Arduino projects, develop RC planes, make Youtube videos, and solve problems using 3D printing. 
    I use Fusion 360 for CAD. I led an engineering club for my last 2 years of High School. I enjoy City Pop, Taylor Swift, Teresa Teng, J-pop, K-pop, and Mandopop.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I speak English and Thai (but I can't read Thai) and am learning Mandarin/Chinese (HSK 3). I also know American Sign Language (took ASL 25)</p>

<h3>Main Python Projects:</h3>
<p>My Python projects typically involve webscraping or image manipulation. I will try to make walkthrough pages for each of these projects. </p>
<br>
<ul>
    <div class="subsection"><p>"Scarlet Rat"/Scrapes the web using Selenium and uploads results to this website
        <a href="https://muxite.github.io/scarlet_rat_pile.html">(Link to Scarlet Rat)</a>

        </div>
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="subsection"><p>"TicTacToe"/TicTacToe bot that works on any board size and line length. (Will later convert to JS for this website)</p></div>

    <div class="subsection"><p>"Words to Images"/Uses Selenium webscraping to provide images for each word in a sentence.</p></div>

</ul>

<div class="section">
<h3>Unity Projects (C#):</h3>
<p>I use Unity for making simulations and sometimes games. I am often too ambitious with these projects (+ C# isnt my main language)</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <div class="subsection"><p>"Evolium"/Simulates creatures with individual parts built based on a genome. On indefinite haitus due to difficulty.</p></div>
    <div class="subsection"><p>"DeadReckoning"/App for determining position based on initial GPS position and accelerometer+gyroscope readings. Failed due not knowing quaternions.</p></div>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Engineering Club Projects:</h3>
    <p>I cofounded and was president of this club at QEHS. It aimed to solve problems around the school and teach students skills, or help them find their passions.
        It was student-led and was initially pitched as the "solutions club" to design and build requests from teachers and other clubs. 
        Some projects failed, some succeeded, or laid the groundwork for someone else to persue. It was very funding focused, resource intensive, and time intensive. 
        I hope someone else will try this type of club at their school.

    <ul>
        <div class="subsection"><p>"GradBricks"/Continued the school tradition of wall paintings for graduating students (but direct painting is banned by the school board). 
            Set a precedent for future grad bricks, recieved 31 painted boards compared to the previous year's 7.</p></div>
        <div class="subsection"><p>Teaching/Taught middle schoolers Fusion 360. Attempted to teach calculus to one.</p></div>
        <div class="subsection"><p>Provided a space for students to use construction workshop, computer lab, 3D printers and laser cutters after school and persue their own projects.</p></div>
        <div class="subsection"><p>"Composter"/Designed a rotating composter, got $150 but lacked time and tools to build it.</p></div>
        <div class="subsection"><p>"Mobile Planter"/Designed and built an elevator compatible wheeled rack for moving plants in the building. Cost $150.98</p></div>

    <h3>RC Planes:</h3>
        <p>I build RC planes and fly them. I have a Basic Drone License. I am on my 5th project. I hope to use Arduino to give it a accelerometer-based stability assistance system.
