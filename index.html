                To learn more, I want to recommend two resources. First is the “Restore the Glory” podcast with Dr. Bob Schuchts and Jake Khym, especially the five part series “The Anatomy of a Wound.” (Episodes 12-16) And second, you may what to check out Dr. Bob Schuchts’ book <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Be-Healed-Guide-Encountering-Powerful/dp/1594714762"><em>Be Healed</em></a></strong>.I truly believe that the God who loves us wants us to be free. But he won’t force us. He won’t heal our wounds without our permission and cooperation.Let’s let him get to work.© 1999-2023 <a href="https://archden.org">Archdiocese of Denver</a>.
