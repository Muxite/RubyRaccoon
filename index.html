<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/comments/6d4e54/manga_spoilers_keeping_it_in_the_family/">with Yoshitoki’s blood. </a> <br/>
<strong>"Those that carry the blood of humans"</strong>: branch families consisting of human and possibly half-human mothers that can only apparently birth half-human stock like Arima and Furuta.
  
    The "Wombs" that are specifically chosen <strong>"to ensure the preservation of a pure bloodline"</strong>: ghoul females that have very powerful kagune potential like Rize and would be used to birth strong ghouls for the main branch.
  
    It's a pretty extensive and sensible program. Tsuneyoshi was trying to pass down his superior genes to create a stronger generation. We can assume that V associates like Kaiko were a failed generation but given enough responsibility to have a high ranking in V. Arima was the creme of the crop and a prodigy that was valued enough that Tsuneyoshi <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="http://readms.net/r/tokyo_ghoulre/074/3373/1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">actually visited him in the Sunlit Garden when Arima was a child</a>. Both Tsuneyoshi and <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="http://readms.net/r/tokyo_ghoulre/063/3218/13" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Kaiko</a> are some of the only individuals in the entire series that referred to Arima by his first name.
  
    I'm thinking their defect might be binge eating.
  
    It's an interesting idea but it could also have to do with how potent Rize's RC factor might have been. There's the fact that the CCG were manufacturing and hoarding liquefied ghoul using the Sphinx Company as a cover. Liquefied ghoul is used in the development of quinque as well as for the creation of RC suppressant. This means that high-ranking members of the Washuu like Tsuneyoshi, Yoshitoki, and Matsuri were most likely frequently dosing themselves with suppressant to keep their high levels in check and also why we never see any kagune from either of them.
  
    Without access to suppressant, Rize probably needed a steady supply for her kakuhou. Whether that can be considered a "defect" is debatable. Bodybuilders, runners, and other types of athletes need to consume a large amount of calories for their bodies to balance out in the physical activity that they engage in.
  
    <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="http://readms.net/r/tokyo_ghoulre/065/3243/8" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Consider Rize's physical state after Kanou's experiments</a>. Two years after the fact, her body is still frail and recovering from her kakuhou being extracted over 200 times (and amusingly and cruelly enough, Furuta subjected her to a hundred more extractions). She is not the spunky lost child that she was when Shachi adopted her or the voluptuous free spirit that we met at the start of the series. Rize's body is just a mess.
  
    Now why aren't Kaneki, Amon, and Takizawa binge eating? <a class="relative pointer-events-auto" href="http://readms.net/r/tokyo_ghoulre/090/3639/10" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">Because half-ghouls don't need to,  as long as they keep getting hurt</a>. They can powerlevel their kakuja of course as was the case with Kaneki at the Restaurant and Kurona on Rue. If feeding and replenishing their RC-cell levels can be considered a "defect", Kanou's experiments have succeeded in removing it.
