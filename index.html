    completely unrelated to that incident i’ve had suicidal ideations most of my life. sometimes you’re suffering so much that all you can think of is ending the pain.
  
    im sorry you had to witness that and i hope you heal. please talk to someone. give yourself time and be patience with yourself. you don’t forget it or heal overnight but it does get easier.
  
    When I was maybe 15, my family and I were on a vacation in San Diego. We were merging onto a highway, and we watched a man run from the shoulder of the highway into the lanes of traffic and watched him get hit by a semi truck. We all still think about it to this day.
  
    I can slightly empathise with you on this one. We were walking down a street, it was a pretty quiet day but a man timed his leap off a building in time to land right next to me. I still hear his bones crunching when I go to sleep. I’ll always feel resentment as well, and I will never know if he made it or not but it’s left me permanently on edge when I walk down that street.

                You'll want to check what jurisdiction/venue the insurer would look to settle disputes in. Assuming the UK angle was correct, in the absence of a definition supplied by the insurer themselves I'd be inclined to fall back to the most relevant piece of primary legislation that does include a definition.<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/66/section/329" rel="nofollow">Section 329 of the Highways act 1980</a> includes a definition of "made-up" as:<em>“made-up carriageway” means a carriageway, or a part thereof, which has been metalled or in any other way provided with a surface suitable for the passage of vehicles;</em>"Unmade-up" is probably reasonable to conclude as the opposite of this term, although if you end up in an important discussion where that distinction is sufficiently critical to the outcome clearly you'd need to defer to someone qualified to give advice on contract terms.Note that unadopted has a rather different meaning - <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69/section/66" rel="nofollow">Byways open to traffic</a> (<a href="http://bendifroot.com/2015/11/take-a-boat-through-green-lanes-byways-open-to-all-traffic-are-the-countrysides-best-kept-secret/" rel="nofollow">BOATS</a>) would be considered adopted for example and hence "unadopted" would not exclude <a href="http://www.britishblades.com/forums/showthread.php?172628-Greenlaning-Wales-Strata-Florida-(warning-pic-heavy)" rel="nofollow">this road</a>.According to the <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/made-up">Free Dictionary</a>, for <strong>made-up</strong>:Also (thanks to @user568458) from <a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/made-up">Collins</a>:In Australia we don't say "unmade up road" we just say "unmade road".
