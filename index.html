                Canada's defence department refused to answer questions about how the weapon was selected and what it knew about the safety concerns and misfires."To maintain the integrity of the ongoing investigation and owing to security requirements, we are not in a position to provide detailed information on the procurement of the small arms weapons system involved in this incident," said Grant, who added the government's procurement regulations are clear and that military purchases are subject to rigorous trials.Senior reporter, defence and securityMurray Brewster is senior defence writer for CBC News, based in Ottawa.

                To learn more, I want to recommend two resources. First is the “Restore the Glory” podcast with Dr. Bob Schuchts and Jake Khym, especially the five part series “The Anatomy of a Wound.” (Episodes 12-16) And second, you may what to check out Dr. Bob Schuchts’ book <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Be-Healed-Guide-Encountering-Powerful/dp/1594714762"><em>Be Healed</em></a></strong>.I truly believe that the God who loves us wants us to be free. But he won’t force us. He won’t heal our wounds without our permission and cooperation.Let’s let him get to work.© 1999-2023 <a href="https://archden.org">Archdiocese of Denver</a>.
